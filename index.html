   <pre>
     While Internal combustion engines (ICEs)  are indispensable to both modern transportation and industry, 
     they represent a major source of air pollution through the emission of nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons.   
     These emissions have various effects on air quality degradation, public health, and the development of environmental problems like climate change. 
     This article sets forth discussions on pollutant formation mechanisms, environmental impacts, and mitigation strategies, including clean fuel innovation and advanced exhaust systems.  
     It focuses on how technology must combine with policies for sustainable attainment of emission reductions and improved air quality.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Introduction_InText">
    Air quality has become a serious environmental and public health concern, especially in metropolitan areas where dense traffic of vehicles contributes much to pollution. 
    Among the biggest contributors are internal combustion engines, which power millions of vehicles worldwide but emit a great deal of harmful pollutants. 
    These include NOx, PM, CO, and HC, which degrade air quality, have harmful effects on respiratory health, and promote climate change through complex interactions in the atmosphere. 
    This review outlines the challenges that ICE emissions pose and proposes pathways to cleaner air with the aid of technological innovation and regulatory measures.
  </pre>

    <h3 id="Mechanisms leading to pollutant formation">Mechanisms leading to pollutant formation</h3>
<p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Analysis_InText">
    Internal combustion engines operate under high temperature and pressure to burn fuel, hence providing a favourable environment for formation of pollutants. The primary sources include:
    Incomplete combustion: leading to the emission of CO and hydrocarbons from unburned or partially burned fuel.
    High-temperature oxidation: Most NOx is formed by reactions of oxygen and nitrogen present in the air under extreme conditions  <a href="#ref-zhang2021">(Zhang et al., 2021)</a>.
    Soot and particulate matter: Forms in fuel-rich zones where combustion is inefficient, producing fine particulate matter that is loaded with harmful chemicals <a href="#ref-who2020">(WHO, 2020)</a>.
    The variety of pollutants that are released to the atmosphere by ICEs have far-reaching effects:
    Nitrogen oxides (NOx): A contribution to smog and acid rain and respiratory diseases  <a href="#ref-epa2019">(EPA, 2019)</a>.
    Particulate matter (PM): ultra-fine particles that penetrate deep into the lungs, thereby posing serious health problems and decreasing visibility (World Health Organization, 2021).
    Carbon monoxide: a poisonous substance together with the ability to stink and affect transportation mechanisms of blood in the body  <a href="#ref-smith2022">(Smith et al., 2022)</a>.
    Hydrocarbons: They are known to enhance the formation of ground-level ozone and other forms of air pollution.
  </pre>
</p>

<h3 id="Impact on Air Quality and Health">Impact on Air Quality and Health</h3>
<p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Analysis_InText">
    Urban areas are mostly affected by ICE emissions due to congested roads and vehicle concentration. 
    Pollutants like NOx and HC combine with sunlight to form ground-level ozone, a critical part of smog. 
    All this leads to increased incidences of respiratory diseases, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) <a href="#ref-chen2020">(Chen, 2020)</a>.
    Aside from urban health concerns, ICE emissions degrade ecosystems and climate:
    Acid deposition: NOx, through acid deposition, alters pH, leading to damage to soils and aquatic systems  <a href="#ref-smith2022">(Smith et al., 2022)</a>.
    Particulate matter and climate: PM directly affects climate by warming or cooling depending on composition and indirectly affects by influencing cloud properties <a href="#ref-who2020">(WHO, 2020)</a>.
  </pre>
</p>

<h3 id="Mitigation Strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h3>
<p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Analysis_InText">
    In certain cases, fuel developments can lead to great emission reductions:
    Low-sulfur fuels: Reduced sulfur in fuels gives rise to lower SOx and particulate matter emissions formation.
    Alternative fuels: Hydrogen, biofuels, and synthetic fuel allow combustion with lower emissions <a href="#ref-johnson2021">(Johnson & Lee, 2021)</a>.
    Novel technologies serve to treat exhaust gases in ways to reduce pollution. 
    Catalytic converters: Convert NOx, CO, and HC in exhaust gas to relatively inert compounds such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water  <a href="#ref-epa2019">(EPA, 2019)</a>.
    Diesel particulate filter: These systems capture fine PM very well and are especially important for diesel engines.
    Selective catalytic reduction: Technology that uses solutions based on urea or ammonia to considerably reduce NOx emissions  <a href="#ref-zhang2021">(Zhang et al., 2021)</a>.
    The use of both fully electric and hybrid-electric vehicles contributes to a quality clean transport paradigm shift. 
    They reduce, if not completely eliminate, tailpipe emissions and thus eco-friendliness as alternatives to ICEs. 
    There also exists an added environmental boost through further capitalization on renewable energy sources in power generation <a href="#ref-chen2020">(Chen, 2020)</a>.
  </pre>
</p>

<h3 id="Policy and Regulatory Frameworks">Policy and Regulatory Frameworks</h3>
<p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Analysis_InText">
    Currently, The Euro 6 and Tier 3 legislation within Europe and the US obliges manufacturers to innovate in reducing ICE emissions. 
    Broadly construed, these regulations enable a level playing field across different countries for emissions reduction while backing promising technologies <a href="#ref-johnson2021">(Johnson & Lee, 2021)</a>.
    The incentives are clear, and it is nonsequential to state that the role of governments in this respect cannot be overemphasized. Subsidies for electric vehicles, investment in renewable energy infrastructures, 
    and resourcing research into low-emission technologies that form a pathway to freedom from previously polluting ICEs <a href="#ref-smith2022">(Smith et al., 2022)</a>.
    Various research and technological innovations create a platform for a more efficient fight against ICE emissions.
    Combustion Optimization: New technologies such as HCCI allow almost complete combustion, reducing polluting emissions  <a href="#ref-zhang2021">(Zhang et al., 2021)</a>.
    Carbon Capture: Post-combustion systems for capturing and storing CO2 are useful in lessening ICE climate impact <a href="#ref-johnson2021">(Johnson & Lee, 2021)</a>.
    Artificial Intelligence in Engine Control: AI systems can optimize fuel-air mixtures to enhance combustion to minimize emissions <a href="#ref-chen2020">(Chen, 2020)</a>.
    All-inclusive solutions require a multidisciplinary intervention to bring together a full integration of engineering to environmental science in relation to emissions.
    Considerations existential: Challenges for Implementation. Innovative Opportunities. 
  </pre>
</p>

<h3 id="Obstacles in Implementing Low-Emission Technologies">Obstacles in Implementing Low-Emission Technologies</h3>
<p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Analysis_InText">
    Barriers to the transition toward less-emitting technologies include:
    Limitations in infrastructure: These hinder adoption since inadequate charging networks exist for electric vehicles <a href="#ref-smith2022">(Smith et al., 2022)</a>.
    Cost Concerns: Their higher upfront costs for alternative fuels and advanced technologies stand in the way of widespread implementation.
    Industry Resistance: Industries tied to traditional ICE systems often resist change due to the economic and logistic burdens involved <a href="#ref-johnson2021">(Johnson & Lee, 2021)</a>.
    The global agenda for achieving net-zero emissions offers a huge opportunity for innovation. 
    Research institutions like Duquesne University stress a greenhouse gas inventory reference standard and renewable energy adoption as being crucial to cleaner energy systems,
    and a sustainable future <a href="#ref-duquesne2023">(Duquesne University, 2023)</a>.
  </pre>

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Analysis_InText">
    While the internal combustion engine is beneficial to modern transport and spare parts, 
    its emissions pose significant health and environmental problems. Some plausible means of alleviation would include cleaner fuels, 
    advanced exhaust treatment technologies, and conversion to electric vehicles. Other success factors include comprehensive policies, international coordination, and continuing technological advances. 
    There is a detailed project to develop clean energy strategies, thereby providing a better atmosphere along with good air.
